![Alt text](/screenshot.png?raw=true "GPX Viewer")

This is a simple app for viewing GPX files. It aims to visualise the GPX tracks on a map.

It's built using Electron and ReactJS, and also uses Webpack and Sass. The Javascript is actually Typescript.

## Run

- clone the project, cd in
- `yarn` to install deps
- open two terminals
	- in one: `yarn dev` this starts a webpack watch task to build all assets.
	- in the other: `yarn start` this starts the electron app.
